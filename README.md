# Download Product Photos
This Opencart module will allow your users to download your product photos right from the product page.

## Getting Started
First, upload all of the files included in the "upload" folder to your Opencart store. Second, install the module from the admin dashboard. Third, click "edit" on the module row that reads "Download Product Photos" and enable to module.

### Prerequisites
You will need the latest version of VQMod, jQuery, and your theme must use Bootstrap. You must also enable the PHP libzip library for the Zip Archive to function. **Compatible with Opencart 1.5.6.x.**

### How To Enable PHP libzip
Enabling libzip will depend on what type of system you are using. For Windows servers, as of PHP 5.3, this extension is built-in. For Linux, you must compile PHP with zip support by using the **--enable-zip** configure option. For more information on enabling libzip, have a look here: [PHP Zip Docs](http://php.net/manual/en/zip.installation.php).
